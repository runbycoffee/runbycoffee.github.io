      <description>In my quest for privacy and security, I&amp;rsquo;ve made use of a great many different tools. It seemed wise to document these for others, to save time and provide options that may not have been considered before.
 2 Factor Auth - YubiKey has been my staple for 2FA for a long time now. Initially I started off using it just for TOTP, but have progress to FIDO2 as services have supported it.</description>

      <description>A VPN is a great solution for privacy, and at times, a great solution for security too. Many people run VPN&amp;rsquo;s using software installed on their PC&amp;rsquo;s - this is absolutely better than nothing, but can still give room for error if the connection disconnects and the software contains no killswitch, or, the software&amp;rsquo;s killswitch doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as designed.
Additionally, you may accidentally forget to turn your VPN on, or, if your PC is booting up, you may inadvertently leak personal information prior to the VPN turning on.</description>
